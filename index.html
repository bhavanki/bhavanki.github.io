        <h3>Welcome!</h3>

<p>I'm happy to finally be able to post some small projects of mine here. I hope they help you like they've helped me!</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>I'm a software developer by trade, recently hired by the fine folks at <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/">Cloudera</a>, but with fifteen years of professional experience before that. I've always tried to share code and libraries I've made with others, but it's been difficult to do so in a public repository until recently due to contractual restrictions. Nowadays, though, I really enjoy using GitHub as a place to offer up what I've got and grab what others provide.</p>

<p>I'm also a committer and PMC member on <a href="http://accumulo.apache.org/">Apache Accumulo</p>, which is <a href="https://github.com/apache/accumulo">mirrored on Github</a>, so feel free to check it out (pun intended).</p>

<p>For more about me, check my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/billhavanki">LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>

<h3>Repos</h3>

<p>I'll highlight some of my public repos. They are all small projects. My goal is to get something mentioned on <a href="http://onethingwell.org">One Thing Well</a>. :)</p>

<p>See them all on my <a href="https://github.com/kbzod">repo page</a>.</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/kbzod/lasa">lasa</a></h4>

<p>You don't have root, so you can't set up monitoring on servers where your code lives. This little utility gets you something, at least: a simple report on a variety of things you can still check on without having root access. You can even set up email notifications if something goes wrong.</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/kbzod/litlca">litlca</a></h4>

<p>Openssl incantations are obscure. Use this set of scripts to more easily run a CA using openssl. Great for testing.</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/kbzod/javacodeformatter">javacodeformatter</a></h4>

<p>I'm not beholden to an IDE. Still, there are times when you need to format your Java code, say, according to your team's standards, and you don't want to spin up Eclipse just to do it. This JAR takes care of things from the command line.</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/kbzod/simplenote-export">simplenote-export</a></h4>

<p>These scripts help massage plain text export of <a href="http://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a> notes for use in other systems. I created them to get my notes ready for access via <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a>.

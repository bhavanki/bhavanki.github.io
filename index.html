        <h3>Welcome!</h3>

<p>I'm happy to finally be able to post some small projects of mine here. I hope they help you like they've helped me!</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>I'm a software developer by trade, with well over a decade of professional experience. I've always tried to share code and libraries I've made with others, and so I really enjoy using GitHub as a place to offer what I've got and grab what others provide.</p>

<p>For more, check my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/billhavanki">LinkedIn page</a>.</p>

<h3>Repos</h3>

<p>I'll highlight some of my public repos. They are all small projects. My goal is to get something mentioned on <a href="http://onethingwell.org">One Thing Well</a>. :)</p>

<p>See them all on my <a href="https://github.com/kbzod">repo page</a>.</p>

<p>You don't have root, so you can't set up monitoring on servers where your code lives. This little utility gets you something, at least: a simple report on a variety of things you can still check on without having root access. You can even set up email notifications if something goes wrong.</p>

<p>Openssl incantations are obscure. Use this set of scripts to more easily run a CA using openssl. Great for testing.</p>

<p>I'm not beholden to an IDE. Still, there are times when you need to format your Java code, say, according to your team's standards, and you don't want to spin up Eclipse just to do it. This JAR takes care of things from the command line.</p>

        <h3>Welcome!</h3>

<p>Hello there. I hope that you're having a good day.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>I'm a software developer by trade, working for the fine folks at <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/">Cloudera</a> since mid-2013, but with fifteen years of professional experience before that. I've always tried to share code and libraries I've made with others, but pre-Cloudera it was difficult for me to do so in a public repository due to contractual restrictions. Nowadays, though, I really enjoy using GitHub as a place to offer up what I've got and grab what others provide.</p>

<p>These days I work on <a href="https://www.cloudera.com/products/product-components/cloudera-director.html">Cloudera Director</a>. It's not open source, but pieces of it are!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Director uses plugins for supporting cloud providers. There are an <a href="https://github.com/cloudera/director-spi">SPI</a> and associated <a href="https://github.com/cloudera/director-spi-tck">TCK</a> available for you to start with.</li>
  <li>The plugins that Director uses for <a href="https://github.com/cloudera/director-aws-plugin">AWS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cloudera/director-google-plugin">Google Cloud Platform</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/cloudera/director-azure-plugin">Azure</a> are all open source. We also have an <a href="https://github.com/cloudera/director-byon-plugin-example">example plugin</a> that can be a useful starting point.</li>
  <li>Lots of other goodies are available in the <a href="https://github.com/cloudera/director-scripts">director-scripts</a> repo.</li>
  <li>While we don't accept PRs for it since it's automatically generated, our <a href="https://github.com/cloudera/director-sdk">SDK</a> code is available for use.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before working on Director, I was active in the following <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> projects.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://accumulo.apache.org/">Apache Accumulo</a> [<a href="https://github.com/apache/accumulo">Github mirror</a>] - committer and PMC member</li>
  <li><a href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/">Apache ZooKeeper</a> [<a href="https://github.com/apache/zookeeper">Github mirror</a>] - contributor</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to check out any of those projects (pun intended).</p>

<h3>Repositories</h3>

<p>I'll highlight some of my own public repos. They are all small projects. My goal is to get something mentioned on <a href="http://onethingwell.org">One Thing Well</a>. :)</p>

<p>See them all on my <a href="https://github.com/bhavanki">repo page</a>.</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/bhavanki/moving-hadoop-to-the-cloud">moving-hadoop-to-the-cloud</a></h4>

<p>Oh, hey, I wrote a <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920051459.do">book on Hadoop in the cloud</a>! This repository holds the code from the book, and perhaps a little bit more ...</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/bhavanki/lasa">lasa</a></h4>

<p>You don't have root, so you can't set up monitoring on servers where your code lives. This little utility gets you something, at least: a simple report on a variety of things you can still check on without having root access. You can even set up email notifications if something goes wrong.</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/bhavanki/litlca">litlca</a></h4>

<p>OpenSSL incantations are obscure. Use this set of scripts to more easily run a CA using openssl. Great for testing.</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/bhavanki/javacodeformatter">javacodeformatter</a></h4>

<p>I'm not beholden to an IDE. Still, there are times when you need to format your Java code, say, according to your team's standards, and you don't want to spin up Eclipse just to do it. This JAR takes care of things from the command line.</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/bhavanki/simplenote-export">simplenote-export</a></h4>

<p>These scripts help massage plain text export of <a href="http://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a> notes for use in other systems. I created them to get my notes ready for access via <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a>.</p>

<h4><a href="https://github.com/bhavanki/titubate">titubate</a></h4>

<p>This is a framework for running "randomwalk" tests, which means your test runner wanders randomly across a directed graph of test actions. The framework is refactored out of Apache Accumulo.</p>
